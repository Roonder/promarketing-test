# Game Cards a Buttons Components - Promarketing Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and implemented with TypeScript.

## Technology Used

[TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

[React-Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) svg react icons of popular icon packs.

[SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) React Hooks for Data Fetching.

[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/) TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies from the `package.json` using the command: `npm i` _(or `npm install`)_

After this, run the development server by using the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Right there you'll be able to check the Game's Grid _(which it can show some icons without an image due the lacking of them in the Figma document provided)_, and check the Buttons displayed by navigating using the top navbar.

I hope the job done here is liked by you guys, and I'm looking forward to keep doing amazing projects like this one.

My best regards.
